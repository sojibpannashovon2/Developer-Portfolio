            <p>As a child my favorite toys around, me were mt furbish I had at least 20 different furbish. The issue
                wasn't
                someone else messing with them, the issue is they awaken you, they would talk to one another like I
                taught
                them watch one at a time. An out of absolutely nowhere at any given time, they would talk to one another
                in
                my bedroom.</p>

            <h3>To become a best mama for her</h3>
            <p>
                If you're not a parent yet yourself, handling a teeny-tiny newborn that seems so super-fragile is
                daunting. And when they begin to grow up and develop personalities, you might try to be a version of
                yourself that you think is appropriate, instead of giving your niece or nephew the real deal. As an aunt
                to three, Emily Malloy from Candler, North Carolina, has discovered that she becomes the best 'mentor'
                when she's just herself: silly and fun and engaging.
                "I have discovered to just be myself with my nieces and nephew. I am an active aunt and our weekly and
                bi-weekly encounters include many fun hands-on activities, but the highlights are: Nerf gun fights
                against the zombies (aka grandparents), impromptu dancing, and right now the girls are big into
                makeovers," she shared. When you're spending time with the tots, your mission is to make sure they have
                a ton of fun and exercise out a lot of their energyâ€”so when you send them back to their parents, they'll
                go right to sleep.
